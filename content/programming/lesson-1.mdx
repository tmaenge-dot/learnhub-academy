# Variables and Data Types in Python

In this lesson, you'll learn about Python's fundamental building blocks: variables and data types.

## What are Variables?

Variables are containers that store data values. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put information.

```python
# Creating a variable
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True
```

## Basic Data Types

### 1. Strings (Text)

Strings represent text and are enclosed in quotes:

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = 'Doe'
message = """This is a
multi-line string"""
```

### 2. Integers (Whole Numbers)

```python
score = 100
temperature = -5
year = 2024
```

### 3. Floats (Decimal Numbers)

```python
price = 19.99
pi = 3.14159
temperature = 98.6
```

### 4. Booleans (True/False)

```python
is_active = True
has_permission = False
```

## Variable Naming Rules

✅ **Valid names:**
- `user_name`
- `firstName`
- `age2`
- `_private`

❌ **Invalid names:**
- `2nd_place` (starts with number)
- `first-name` (contains hyphen)
- `class` (reserved keyword)

## Type Conversion

Convert between types:

```python
# String to integer
age = int("25")

# Integer to string
score_text = str(100)

# String to float
price = float("19.99")
```

## Practice Exercise

Create variables for a user profile:

```python
username = "coder123"
email = "user@example.com"
age = 28
is_premium = True
account_balance = 150.75

print(f"User: {username}")
print(f"Balance: ${account_balance}")
```

## Next Lesson

In the next lesson, we'll learn about operators and how to perform calculations with variables.
