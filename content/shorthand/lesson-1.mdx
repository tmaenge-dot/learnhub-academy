# Introduction to Pitman Shorthand

Welcome to your first lesson in Pitman shorthand! This writing system was invented by Sir Isaac Pitman in 1837 and remains one of the most efficient shorthand systems in use today.

## What is Shorthand?

Shorthand is a method of rapid writing that uses symbols to represent letters, words, and phrases. It's particularly useful for:

- **Note-taking** in lectures and meetings
- **Transcription** of speeches and interviews
- **Personal journaling** with increased privacy
- **Professional stenography** in legal and medical fields

## The Pitman System

Pitman shorthand is a **phonetic system**, meaning it represents sounds rather than spelling. This makes it:

1. **Faster** - Write what you hear, not what you spell
2. **More efficient** - One symbol can represent multiple letters
3. **Universal** - Works across different English dialects

## Basic Principles

### Consonants

In Pitman shorthand, consonants are represented by straight lines and curves:

- Straight strokes: `T`, `D`, `P`, `B`, `CH`, `J`
- Curved strokes: `F`, `V`, `TH`, `S`, `Z`, `SH`

### Vowels

Vowels are indicated by dots and dashes positioned around consonant strokes:

- Light dots for short vowels (a, e, i, o, u)
- Heavier marks for long vowels

## Your First Symbols

Let's start with three basic strokes:

1. **P** - A light downward stroke
2. **T** - A heavy downward stroke  
3. **K** - A short horizontal stroke to the right

## Practice Exercise

Try writing these simple words:

- **pat** = P + A (dot above) + T
- **pit** = P + I (dot below) + T  
- **pot** = P + O (dash above) + T

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll learn more consonant strokes and how to join them together to form words.
