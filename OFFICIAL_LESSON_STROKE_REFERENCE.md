## COMPLETE 24 CONSONANTS + 2 VARIANTS = 26 STROKES

### LESSON 1 - EXPLODENTS (8 consonants - Straight Strokes)

**Explodents** = consonant sounds formed by the outgoing breath being forced in a sudden gust through barriers previously closed.

| Letter | Stroke | Name | Orientation | Length | Weight | Examples |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **P** | `\` | pee | 45° down left | 1/6" | Light | pole, top, tape |
| **B** | `\` | bee | 45° down left | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** | bat, tub, goat |
| **T** | `\|` | tee | 90° down (vertical) | 1/6" | Light | tape, dog, food |
| **D** | `\|` | dee | 90° down (vertical) | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** | dog, patch, edge |
| **CH** | `/` | chay | 30° down right | 1/6" | Light | check, patch, just |
| **J** | `/` | jay | 30° down right | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** | just, edge, came |
| **K** | `—` | kay | Horizontal (left to right) | 1/6" | Light | came, look, game |
| **G** | `—` | gay | Horizontal (left to right) | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** | game, fog, look |

**Note:** All explodents are STRAIGHT LINE strokes. Light vs Heavy pairs: P-B, T-D, CH-J, K-G.

### LESSON 1A - CONTINUANTS (8 consonants - Curved Strokes)

**Continuants** = outgoing breath is allowed to escape in a continuous stream through partially closed barriers. Represented by **quarter-circles** (shallow curves).

| Letter | Stroke | Name | Orientation | Length | Weight | Examples |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **F** | `(` | ef | 45° down (left to right) | 1/6" | Light | feet, life, sale |
| **V** | `(` | vee | 45° down (left to right) | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** (tapered edges) | van, move, zero |
| **th** | `)` | ith | 90° down | 1/6" | Light | thin, bath, show |
| **TH** | `)` | THee | 90° down | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** (tapered edges) | That, breathe, pleasure |
| **S** | `)` | ess | 90° down | 1/6" | Light | sale, lace, cash |
| **Z** | `)` | zee | 90° down | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** (tapered edges) | zero, craze, closure |
| **sh** | `\` | ish | 45° down (right to left) | 1/6" | Light | show, cash |
| **zh** | `\` | zhee | 45° down (right to left) | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** (tapered edges) | pleasure, closure |

**Note:** All continuants are CURVED STROKES (quarter-circles/shallow curves). Light vs Heavy pairs: F-V, th-TH, S-Z, sh-zh.

**Important:** Heavy (thick) curved strokes are to be **tapered at the edges and thickened in the middle**.

### LESSON 1B - NASALS, LIQUIDS, COALESCENTS (8 consonants)

#### NASALS (3 consonants - Horizontal Curves)
**Nasals** = produced by closing the successive barriers in the mouth, air escapes through the nose.

| Letter | Stroke | Name | Orientation | Length | Weight | Examples |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **M** | `~` | em | Horizontal (left to right) | 1/6" | Light curve | men, him |
| **N** | `~` | en | Horizontal (left to right) | 1/6" | Light curve | neat, sun |
| **NG** | `~` | ing (or ng) | Horizontal (left to right) | 1/6" | **Heavy/Thick** curve (tapered edges) | king, bang |

#### LIQUIDS (2 consonants - Curved strokes at 45°)
**Liquids** = flow into union with other consonants (like in 'try', 'play').

| Letter | Stroke | Name | Orientation | Length | Weight | Examples |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **L** | `↗` | el | 45° upward (left to right) | 1/6" | Light curved upstroke | like, kill |
| **R** (form 1) | `↘` | ar | 45° downward (left to right) | 1/6" | Light curved downstroke | ram, care |
| **R** (form 2) | `↗` | ray | 30° upward straight (left to right) | 1/6" | Light straight upstroke | ring, carry |

**Note:** R has TWO forms - 'ar' (curved down) and 'ray' (straight up at 30°). Always call the upward form "ray".

#### COALESCENTS (2 consonants - Initially Hooked Upstrokes)
**Coalescents** = precede vowels and unite (coalesce) with them.

| Letter | Stroke | Name | Orientation | Length | Weight | Examples |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **W** | `↗` with initial hook | way | 30° upward (left to right) | 1/6" | Light, initially hooked | win, away |
| **Y** | `↗` with initial hook | yay | 30° upward (left to right) | 1/6" | Light, initially hooked | yes, yoke |

## STROKE WRITING RULES

1. **Uniform Length:** All strokes = 1/6" inch (later you'll learn double-length and half-length)
2. **Single Inflection:** Write strokes with single movement - no overwriting, correction, erasing
3. **Light Strokes:** Written with light pressure
4. **Heavy Strokes:** Apply a little extra pressure (don't overwrite thin strokes)
5. **Curved Heavy Strokes:** Must be tapered at edges and thickened in the middle
6. **Direction:** Follow the orientation exactly as specified
7. **Sound-Based:** Pay attention to SOUNDS of English, not letters of longhand

- **Heavy/Thick (10):** B, D, J, G, V, TH, Z, zh, NG

### Light/Heavy Pairs:
1. P - B (45° down left)
2. T - D (vertical down)
3. CH - J (30° down right)
4. K - G (horizontal)
5. F - V (45° down curve)
6. th - TH (90° down curve)
7. S - Z (90° down curve)
8. sh - zh (45° right-left curve)
9. N - NG (horizontal curve)

## CONSONANT SOUNDS vs LETTERS

- **Same sound, single stroke:** 'c' and 's' both use S stroke
- **Same sound, single stroke:** 'j' and 'g' both use J stroke
- **Combined sounds:** 'x' = K + S (two strokes)
- **Two-letter sounds:** 'th', 'TH', 'sh', 'zh' (single strokes for each)
