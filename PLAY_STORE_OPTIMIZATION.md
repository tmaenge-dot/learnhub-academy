# 🏆 Play Store Success Guide - Make Your App Outstanding & Easy to Find

## 💰 PAYMENT SETUP - IMPORTANT INFORMATION

### How Google Play Payments Work

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Google Play does **NOT** support direct PayPal payments for in-app purchases.

#### Payment Flow:
1. **User purchases** → Google Play processes payment
2. **Google collects** → Holds funds (15% fee)
3. **Monthly payout** → Google pays YOU via bank transfer
4. **You receive** → 85% of revenue in your bank account

#### Setting Up Payments (Google Play Console):

**Option 1: Bank Transfer (Recommended)** ✅
- Setup: Payments → Payment profiles
- Required: Bank account details
  - Account holder: Your name
  - Bank name
  - Account number
  - Routing/SWIFT code
- Payment schedule: Monthly (NET30 - 30 days after month end)
- Minimum payout: $0 (no minimum)

**Option 2: PayPal Indirect Setup** (Workaround)
While you can't receive Google Play payments directly to PayPal, you can:
1. Receive Google payments to your bank account
2. Set up auto-transfer from bank → PayPal
3. Or manually transfer funds to PayPal

**What You Need**:
- Bank account in your name
- Tax information (W-8BEN for non-US, W-9 for US)
- Address verification
- Email: tmaenge@gmail.com (for Google account)
