# ✅ CORRECTED: AI Vision Stroke Analysis with Proper Sound Names

## 🎯 STROKE SOUNDS (Not Letter Names!)

The strokes are named by their PHONETIC SOUNDS, not alphabetic letters:

### Corrected Stroke Names

| Stroke | Sound | NOT Called | Example Words |
|--------|-------|------------|---------------|
| **ITH** | ith (voiceless th) | ~~TH~~ | thick, think, bath |
| **THE** | the (voiced th) | ~~TH~~ | this, that, bathe |
| **ISH** | ish | ~~SH~~ | she, fish, wish |
| **ZHEE** | zhee | ~~ZH~~ | measure, vision, beige |

## 📊 Complete Weight Pairs (Corrected)

| Light Stroke | ↔ | Heavy Stroke | Difference |
|--------------|---|--------------|------------|
| **F** | ↔ | **V** | Same right-opening curve, V is thicker |
| **ITH** (thin) | ↔ | **THE** (this) | Same left-opening curve, THE is thicker |
| **S** | ↔ | **Z** | Same shallow left curve, Z is thicker |
| **ISH** | ↔ | **ZHEE** | Same deep left curve, ZHEE is thicker |
| **N** | ↔ | **NG** | Same diagonal stroke, NG is thicker |
| **W** | ≈ | **Y** | Similar upward curves, Y is smaller |

## 🔄 Mirror Pairs (Corrected)

| Right-Opening | ↔ | Left-Opening | Relationship |
|---------------|---|--------------|--------------|
| **F** (light) | ↔ | **ITH** (light) | Perfect mirror images |
| **V** (heavy) | ↔ | **THE** (heavy) | Perfect mirror images |

## 📏 Depth Comparison (Corrected)

### Left-Opening Curves (←) by Depth:

1. **SHALLOW** (small, tight curves)
   - **S** (light, shallow)
   - **Z** (heavy, shallow)

2. **MODERATE** (standard curves)
   - **ITH** (light, moderate) - "ith" sound
   - **THE** (heavy, moderate) - "the" sound

3. **DEEP** (large, pronounced curves)
   - **ISH** (light, deep) - "ish" sound
   - **ZHEE** (heavy, deep) - "zhee" sound

## 🎵 Sound Naming Logic

### Why Sound-Based Names?

In Pitman Shorthand, strokes represent **SOUNDS**, not letters:

- **ITH** = the sound you hear in "**th**in", "ba**th**"
- **THE** = the sound you hear in "**th**is", "ba**the**"
- **ISH** = the sound you hear in "**sh**e", "fi**sh**"
- **ZHEE** = the sound you hear in "mea**s**ure", "vi**s**ion"

### Examples in Context:

```
Word: "think"
Sound: "ith" + "ing" + "k"
Strokes: ITH + NG + K

Word: "this"  
Sound: "the" + "i" + "s"
Strokes: THE + dot + S

Word: "fish"
Sound: "f" + "i" + "ish"
Strokes: F + dot + ISH

Word: "measure"
Sound: "m" + "e" + "zhee" + "er"
Strokes: M + dash + ZHEE + R
```

## ✅ AI Vision Recognition Summary

The AI correctly identifies and differentiates strokes by:

1. **Opening Direction**
   - Right (→): F, V
   - Left (←): ITH, THE, S, Z, ISH, ZHEE
   - Upward (↑): W, Y, R

2. **Line Weight**
   - Light: F, ITH, S, ISH, N, W, Y, M
   - Heavy: V, THE, Z, ZHEE, NG

3. **Curve Depth**
   - Shallow: S, Z
   - Moderate: F, V, ITH, THE
   - Deep: ISH, ZHEE

4. **Curve vs Straight**
   - Curved: F, V, ITH, THE, S, Z, ISH, ZHEE, W, Y, R, M
   - Straight: N, NG, P, B, T, D, CH, J, K, G, L

## 🎯 Updated Comparison Chart

```
CURVES OPENING RIGHT (→):
  F:    ( light stroke, moderate depth
  V:    ( heavy stroke, moderate depth

CURVES OPENING LEFT (←):
  S:    ) light stroke, shallow depth
  Z:    ) heavy stroke, shallow depth
  ITH:  ) light stroke, moderate depth (ith sound)
  THE:  ) heavy stroke, moderate depth (the sound)
  ISH:  ) light stroke, deep (ish sound)
  ZHEE: ) heavy stroke, deep (zhee sound)

UPWARD CURVES (↑):
  W:    ⌒ light stroke, standard size
  Y:    ⌒ light stroke, smaller size

STRAIGHT DIAGONALS (↗) - NOT CURVES:
  N:    / light stroke, 45° angle
  NG:   / heavy stroke, 45° angle
