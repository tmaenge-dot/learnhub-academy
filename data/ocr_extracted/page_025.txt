First-place vowels

When the first vowel in a word is a first-place vowel:
1. the outline is written in first position, with the first upstroke,

downstroke or horizontal stroke above the line;

2 the vowel is placed at the beginning of the stroke;
3 where the first stroke is a horizontal, followed by an upstroke or

downstroke, it is the upstroke or downstroke which takes the position.

There are four first-place vowels.

1 Long ah — represented by a heavy dot

Pa, calm, palm, __ pass.
Short a — represented by a light dot
