LESSON —- 1B
CONSONANTS (Zacale, Liguide, Coalescents and Aepinrate)

You learnt “explodents” and
“continuants”, in the previous lessons.
Now, look at the balance eight
consonants and finish learning all the
consonants before proceeding to the next
lessons dealing with joining of strokes

followed by the important lesson on “vowels”.

The first three consonant sounds are called “nasals” because they are
produced by closing the successive barriers in the mouth against the
outgoing air-stream, so that it has to escape through the nose. Nasals ‘m’,
‘n’, ‘ng’ are represented by horizontal curves.

The next two consonant sounds ‘|’ and ‘r’ are called “liquids”, because they
flow into union with other consonants to form double consonants, as in the
words ‘try’, ‘play’ etc. ‘L’ is represented by curved upward light stroke and
‘r’ is represented by downward light curved stroke. ‘R’ is also represented
by an alternative form upward straight upstroke with 30° angle from
horizontal and it should always be called as “Ray”.

The next two consonant sounds ‘w’ and ‘y’ are called “coalescents”
because they precede vowels and unite (coalesce) with them. ‘w’ and ‘y’
are represented by initially hooked straight upstrokes with 30° angle from
horizontal. They are

Aspirate ‘H’

The last consonant sound ‘H’ (named as ‘Hay’) is called “aspirate”. The
aspirate is breathing upon a following vowel. For example, by breathing
upon the vowel ‘i’ in the word ‘it’, the word is changed into ‘hit’.

The aspirate ‘H’ is represented by two forms ‘Hay’ (upward) with initially
circled light upstroke with 30° angle from perpendicular and ‘Hay’
(downward) with initially circled light downstroke with 30° angle from
horizontal.

The following table shows how the aspirate ‘Hay’ is represented.

BRIEF ANALYSIS

> Pitman’s Shorthand is phonetic and is written according to sound
and not according to the ordinary spelling.

> There are 24 consonant sounds represented by 26 shorthand
strokes - ‘r’ and ‘h’ are provided with two alternative forms, one
downward and the other upward.

> The consonants are represented by thin and thick straight
strokes and shallow curves for the representation of pairs of light
and corresponding heavy sounds. Light sounded consonants
are represented by thin strokes and Heavy sounds by thick
strokes.

> Thin strokes are written upward or downward but thick strokes
are never written upward.

> The consonants are divided into six groups arranged according
to their articulation.

> They are

explodents (p, b, t, d, ch, j, k, g)
continuants (f, v, th, TH, s, z, sh, zh)
nasals (m,n, ng)

liquids (| and r)

coalescents (w and y)

aspirate (h)

VVVVVV

> The expl/odents and one upward form of ‘r’ are represented by
straight strokes.

> The consonants ‘w’ and ‘y’ are represented by initially hooked
straight upstrokes.

> The aspirate ‘h’ is represented by initially circled straight up SH
stroke and initially circled straight down stroke. —

is

p, b, t, d, ch, j, r(up) are represented by straight strokes.

Light sounded consonants p, t, ch, ray are represented by light
(thin strokes). p, t, ch, are written downward and ‘R(up)’ is
written upward.

Heavy sounded consonants b, d, j, are represented by heavy
(thick) strokes.

The two consonants (exp/odents) ‘k’, ‘g’ are represented by
straight horizontal strokes written from left to right.

The light sound of ‘k’ is represented by thin stroke and the
heavy sound of ‘g’ is represented by thick stroke.

The strokes are written in three directions; i.e. downward
(resting on the line), upward (starting from the line) and
horizontal (on the line from left to right).

One stroke represents one sound only.
All strokes are to be written with same length of 1/6" of an inch.
All strokes are to be written by single inflection of pen/pencil.

Thick curved strokes are to be written in such a way that the
beginning and ending are tapered.

Start writing the strokes slowly in the beginning and gradually
increase the speed of writing, as you familiarize with them.

In words where ‘t’ appears before ‘ch’ (as in batch, itch) and ‘d’
before ‘j’ (as in adjust), the consonants ‘t’ and ‘d’ are not
pronounced and are silent consonants.

> ‘N’ before ‘k’ or ‘g’ (as in bank, language) is almost always
pronounced as ‘ng’.

> Letters which are not pronounced are ignored and are not
represented in shorthand outlines.

> The same set of consonants are pronounced differently in words;
for example, letter ‘gh’ are silent in many words, such as,
‘though’, ‘high’, ‘fight’, and in the word ‘enough’ ‘gh’ is
pronounced as ‘f’ and in shorthand the word ‘enough’ will have
consonants strokes for ‘n’ and ‘f’.

> Although the two written consonants ‘v’ and ‘w’ are pronounced
very similarly, two separate shorthand strokes have been given
as the sounds are different. Try to pronounce word like
‘devolve’, ‘evolve’, ‘wire’, ‘week’, and you can notice the
difference in the two sounds.

> Pay attention to the sounds of English language, not to the
letters of longhand.

> In the same way that there are bad writers of longhand, there
are bad writers of shorthand, and it is important that every
student makes an attempt to get a good writing behavior and a
tendency automatically to make good shorthand outlines. If this
tendency is formed early in the learning of shorthand, it will be
kept, but if bad writing behavior and tendencies are formed, it is
very hard to overcome them later.
