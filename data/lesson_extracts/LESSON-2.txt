LESSON —- 2
VOWELS

&) NATIONAL SHORTHAND SCHOOL (BOOKS)

You are thorough with all the stroke consonants, joining of strokes
and grasped sounds of the language and phonetic basis of Pitman’s
shorthand system.

Now, this is the time to learn the very important lesson on VOWELS.
Definition of a Vowel:
‘If the mouth passage is left so open as not to cause audible friction,

and voiced breath is sent through it, we have a vowel.” (Prof. Sweet).

The difference between the consonant and vowel is given below:

A consonant is a sound which A vowel is a sound which can be
cannot be produced distinctly produced without the assistance
without the aid of a vowel. of any other.

There are six simple long vowels and six corresponding short vowels
in English language, represented by heavy dot and heavy dash; light
dot and light dash respectively.

LONG VOWELS
The six long vowels are divided into two groups, AH, A, E and AW, O,
oo.

The first group of three vowels AH, A, E are called Lingual vowels
because, in their production, the tongue is mainly concerned and
these three vowels are represented by heavy dot (*).

The next group of three vowels AW, O, OO are called Labial vowels
because, in their production, the lips are mainly concerned and
these three vowels are represented by heavy dash (-)

The three vowels in each group are numbered and are called as first
place vowel, second place vowel and third place vowel. The order of
the vowels in each group corresponds with their utterance by the
vocal organs.

The table below shows the usage of long vowels:

Vowel | Sound |Asin| Sign Place | Sound | As in| Sign
1 place | AH Pa | 1 place | AW all |
2" place A may | 2™ place| O go |
3 place E we | 3 place | OO too |

Based on the above table, the long vowels are to be called by their
distinct names, thus,

AH |First place heavy dot vowel calm, palm, balm |k-m, p-m, b-m

A |Second place heavy dot vowel |Plate, rate, mate |p-I-t, R-t, m-t

E Third place heavy dot vowel Peak, ream, meet |p-k, r-m, m-t

AW ||First place heavy dash vowel Paul, rod, top p-l, R-d, t-p

OQ |Second place heavy dash vowel |Goat, shore, boat |g-t, sh-r, b-t
OO |Third place heavy dash vowel Tour, shoot, boot |t-r, sh-t, b-t

On every stroke, there are three places either side to write the
vowels.

The first place vowels are written at the beginning of a stroke.
The second place vowels are written at the middle of a stroke.
The third place vowels are placed at the end of a stroke.

Vowels are placed either before the stroke (preceding vowel) or
after the stroke (following vowel) according to the occurrence of
vowel, before or after the consonant.

Places are to be counted from the beginning of the stroke in the
direction in which it is written.

While forming outlines for the words, the consonants heard in the
word are written first by joining them together, without lifting the
pen. Then the vowels are placed as they occur naturally in the
word. See the following examples:

. Ee

t at | ata jattack

Find the natural way of
occurring consonants and
vowels in the above word.

In this word, the consonants heard in the word are t & k.
There is a vowel before ‘t’ which is written on the left side
of stroke. One more vowel occurred after ‘t’ which is
written on the right side of stroke. The consonant ‘k’
occurred after ‘t’. In the natural pronunciation of word
‘attack’, t is followed by k. Hence, one vowel before ‘t’ and
the subsequent vowel after ‘t’ are written, forming the
outline for the word ‘attack’ in its natural way.

Some more such examples are given below:

NLS. ~ le ae

b bo bod | body

Please note that the above
is to explain the natural
way in which the word
heard is written in
shorthand.

While writing the outlines, all the consonants heard in the

word are written together without lifting the pen. So

econ) occurred in the word i.e. ‘b’ and ‘d’ are to

be written initially. Then vowels heard in the word are
. 4 .

placed accordingly. \ First place heavy dash vowel

occurred after ‘b’. It } is placed after ‘b’.

Then third place light dot vowel is placed after ‘d’.

This way, the outline for the word ‘body’ is formed.

In this example outline for the word ‘followed’ is written.
The consonants occurred are f — | — d. They are written together.
Vowels are placed after writing the outline.

f-I-d f-o-l-o-d

The vowels occurred in the word are a first
place heavy dash vowel after ‘f’ (f+aw=fo);
and then a second place heavy dash vowel
after ‘|’ (l+o=lo) and there is no vowel after
the last consonant ‘d’. Hence the vowels are
placed accordingly to form the outline for the
word ‘followed’.

The dash vowels may be written at the right and convenient angle to the straight
strokes and like spokes in a wheel direction to the curves.

The vowel signs must be written at a little distance from the strokes to which they are

placed.

Read and practice each of the following outlines, as many times as
possible (in a separate exercise book) to gain knowledge of long
vowels represented by heavy dot and heavy dash.

SHORT VOWELS

The six corresponding short vowels are A, E, I and 0, U, OO.

The first group of three vowels A, E, I are Lingual vowels and these
are represented by light dot (-).

The next group of three vowels 0, U, OO are Labial vowels and these
are represented by light dash (-)

The three vowels in each group are numbered and are called as first
place light dot/dash vowel, second place light dot/dash vowel and
third place light dot/dash vowel. The order of the vowels in each
group corresponds with their utterance by the vocal organs.

The table below shows the usage of short vowels:

Vowel | Sound | Asin | Sign Place | Sound | Asin| Sign
1** place A that | \ 1% place} 0 not | \
2™ place E pen \ | 2 place} U  |much)
3 place i is \. [3% place} 00 | good) \-

Based on the above table, the short vowels are to be called by their
distinct names, thus,

A |First place light dot vowel Bat, cap, pack b-k, c-p, p-k

E Second place light dot vowel Bell, deck, get b-l, d-k, g-t

1 |Third place light dot vowel Bit, chip, mill b-t, ch-p, m-|

0. |First place light dash vowel cot, talk, shop k-t, t-k, sh-p

U  |Second place light dash vowel nut, boat, vote n-t, b-t, v-t

OO [Third place light dash vowel foot, push, wood /f-t, p-sh, w-d
The following sentence reminds you the sequence of short vowels.
that pen Ys not mutch good
1 place 2" place 3 place 1 place 2" place 3 place
light dot light dot light dot light dash light dash light dash

PRECEDING VOWELS
As explained above, when a vowel occurs before consonant it is
called preceding vowel and written before the consonant i.e. on
left hand side to up strokes/down strokes and written above the
horizontal strokes, thus

ape aid if ace air _ ill away earth ache egg aim

FOLLOWING VOWELS
When a vowel occurs after consonant, it is called following vowel
and written after the consonant i.e. on right hand side to up
strokes/ down strokes and written below the horizontal strokes, thus

pay day fee say_ ray low way row key go may

A single consonantal stroke can have a vowel before the consonant
and also after the consonant. In this case both vowels are marked
suitably (example: ‘away’ - see above).
