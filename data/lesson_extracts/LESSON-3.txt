LESSON —- 3
INTERVENING VOWELS : POSITION WRITING : GRAMMALOGUES

&) NATIONAL SHORTHAND SCHOOL (BOOKS)

The two sentences below reminds you of the six long vowels and
six corresponding short vowels written with heavy dot, heavy
dash, light dot and light dash with their places. Memorize it.

The following sentence reminds you the sequence of long vowels.
Pah may we all go too
1 place 2™ place 3 place 1 place 2™ place 3 place
heavy dot heavy dot heavy dot heavy dash_ heavy dash heavy dash

The following sentence reminds you the sequence of short vowels.

that pen Ys not mutch good
1 place 2™ place 3 place 1 place 2™ place 3 place
light dot light dot light dot light dash light dash __light dash

You were also explained preceding vowels and following vowels and
their placement. Now you will learn the intervening vowels:

INTERVENING VOWELS
Any vowel occurring between two strokes is called intervening
vowel, thus pam, fame, peak, bought, door, deep, back, bet, bit,
top, bug, took. Look at the outlines for the words with intervening

vowels occurring between two \ i .
consonant _ strokes. There are \_,., \ ee eet tial
certain rules for writing the vowels a
between strokes, for convenience in | ra ‘Se
writing and also for deciphering  aurtrevenana vowels

them later.

A first place vowel occurring between two |X| XN lL
strokes is written after first stroke mf a sennesfeecccccnecccccccopoonDgscnconcan

A second place vowel occurring between \ .
two strokes is written after first stroke eect k. ve

A third place vowel occurring between
two strokes is written before second
stroke

Exceptions for compound words
The above rules for intervening vowels do not apply for compound
words like head-ache, ear-ache, etc. Vowels are to be written to the
individual outlines, after completing the outline; thus

Vt evvrnnALe. Dye —

head + ache = head-ache ear + ache = ear-ache

POSITION WRITING

Position writing is one of the most important features in Pitman’s
system of shorthand writing. This feature facilitates the writer to
avoid writing vowels at many places while writing at a speed and
also to decipher the outlines easily. Position writing is a must and
should never be neglected. The main reason to use ruled paper for
Pitman shorthand writing is to facilitate the position writing only.
Please see the outlines given as examples so far, are written
according to the position writing rules, though not explained till
now.

When the first vowel heard in word is
a first place vowel, the first upstroke © CL yooF Nv O

or downstroke in the outline is written \S bn <
above the line. .

When the first vowel heard the word
is a second place vowel, the first a) . .
is written on the line.

When the first vowel heard in the
word is a third place vowel, the first
upstroke or downstroke in the outline
is written through the line.

When the outline contains all the
horizontal strokes, the outline is _~

written above the line for first place teem eee
vowel and on the line for second and
third place vowels.

GRAMMALOGUES

The term Grammalogue is derived from two Greek words (gramma =
letter + logos = word). Grammalogues (also called as short forms) are
frequently occurring words represented in shorthand by a single sign.
These signs are called Logograms (word letters). These signs are written
above the line, on the line or through the line. By using the grammalogues,
speed of shorthand writing dramatically increases. Two or more
grammalogues can be joined together and can be added to the outlines
to obtain phraseograms (phrases are written continuously without lifting

the pen).

In the lessons to come, almost, every lesson contains a set of gramma-
logues. These grammalogues are to be practised everyday and should

be committed to memory.

Practice the set of above grammalogues thoroughly and memorize them before taking

up the following exercises.

PUNCTUATION

Punctuation marks represented in shorthand are given below:

Practice the above set of punctuation marks. You have to use them

BRIEF ANALYSIS

a)

> Each stroke consonant represents one distinct sound in English.

> Stroke consonants are joined together without lifting the pen,
writing in their own direction to obtain outlines for the words.

> Thin strokes for consonants ‘I’ and ‘sh’ are written upward or
downward according to rules for convenience.

> There are twelve distinct vowel sounds in English.

> The vowels sounds are represented by small signs of dot and
dash.

> There are six long vowels represented by heavy dot and heavy
dash.

> There are six corresponding short vowels represented by light
dot and light dash.

> On every stroke there are three places, i.e. first place (at the
beginning of stroke); second place (at the middle of stroke) and
third place (at the end of stroke).

> Long vowels are given their distinct places; first place hevy dot
vowel; first place heavy dash vowel; second place heavy dot
vowel; second place heavy dash vowel; third place heavy dot
vowel; third place heavy dash vowel.

> Likewise, short vowels are also given their distinct places; first
place light dot vowel; first place light dash vowel; second place
light dot vowel; second place light dash vowel; third place light
dot vowel; third place light dash vowel.

> Vowel places are counted from the beginning of the stroke.

> Vowel signs are placed on the left side of the stroke if a vowel
sound occurs before the consonant, and placed on the right side
of the stroke if a vowel sound occurs after the consonant and on
both sides if a vowel precedes and a vowel follows the stroke
consonant.

> When writing a word in shorthand, its outline is written first and
then the vowel sign(s) placed.

> Intervening vowel means, a vowel occurring between two
strokes. When a first place vowel occurs between two strokes,
the vowel sign is placed after the first stroke; when a second
place vowel occurs between two strokes, the vowel sign is placed
after the first stroke, but when a third place vowel occurs

between two strokes, the vowel sign is placed before the second
stroke, to avoid confusion while deciphering.

> Outlines are also written in three positions, i.e. above the line,
on the line and through the line.

> When the initial vowel heard in the word is a first place vowel,
the first upstroke/downstroke in the outline is written above the
line.

> When a second place vowel is heard initially in the word, the first
upstroke/downstroke in the outline is written on the line.

> When the first vowel heard in the word is of a third place vowel,
the first upstroke/downstroke in the outline is written through
the line.

> When the outline contains all horizontal strokes, for first place
place — the out line is written above the line, and for second and
third places — the outline is written on the line.

> Frequently occurring words in English language are called
grammalogues or short-forms. The grammalogues are
represented by single strokes (logograms).

> The grammalogues are written above the line, on the line or
through the line.

> The grammalogues can be attached to the outlines to make
phraseograms (representing phrases).
