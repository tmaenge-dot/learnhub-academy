LESSON — 1A
CONSONANTS ( @ocetececcact2)

You learnt in the previous lesson that the first eight consonants i.e.
“explodents” are represented by straight lines (strokes) that are
drawn from these two circles.

Now you will be learning the next eight

because, in pronouncing them, the
outgoing breath is allowed to escape

consonants, called “continuants”, oa x
in’ a continuous’ stream through

partially closed barriers. These “continuants” are represented by
quarter-circles, also called as “shallow curves”, drawn from the
same two circles.

They are

Now, you have to_ start practising the consonants
(continuants), as shown in the following demo pages.
Remember, all the strokes are to be written with the same
length i.e. 1/6" of an inch.

Strokes are to be written with single infliction of pen/pencil.
Light (thin) curves are to be written with light pressure of the
pencil.

Heavy (thick) curved strokes are to be tapered at the
edges and thickened in the middle, as shown in the
examples.
