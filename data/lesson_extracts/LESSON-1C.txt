LESSON —- 1C
JOINING OF STROKES TO MAKE OUTLINES
By now, you are thorough with the consonant sounds and respective
stroke consonants (phonographic alphabet). In this lesson, you will
learn the joining of strokes, to make ‘outlines’, which represent
spoken words in English.

Words in English comprises of consonants and vowels. In
shorthand, all the consonant sounds heard in the word are written
first and then vowels are placed to complete the outline for that
word.

Writing one or more consonant-strokes joined together (as heard in
the word), is called writing ‘outline’. Simply speaking, ‘words’ in
English are called ‘outlines’ in shorthand.

In joining strokes together, they must be written without lifting the
pen/pencil.

The end of the first (previous) stroke and the beginning of the next
(following) stroke are to be joined. All the strokes must be written in
their own direction (as explained in the previous lessons) and with
equal length. (Few exceptions for joining of ‘sh’ and ‘I’ with other
strokes will be explained later).

Read and practise the joining of strokes, as shown in the following demo pages.

If the first stroke in the outline is a downstroke, the first stroke
should rest upon the line and the rest of the strokes will follow in
their own direction; thus

If the first stroke is a horizontal stroke and followed by a down
stroke, the horizontal stroke may be commenced sufficiently above
the line, so that the first downstroke rests upon the line; thus

If a horizontal stroke is followed by another horizontal or an
upstroke, the first horizontal stroke must be written on the line,

If the first stroke in the outline is an upstroke, it must begin on the
line and the rest will follow in their own direction; thus
