Shorthand is easy to learn and you will enjoy mastering a
secret script you can use for the rest of your life.

Writing shorthand is like writing longhand, but it is quicker.
English has some set of signs (alphabet) to record the words.
Shorthand also has some set of geometrical signs. Like
longhand, the shorthand signs also can be read back later or
put them back in longhand words.

Shorthand (Stenography) is learnt by constant, regular and
vigorous practice.

It takes 2 to 6 months to complete the exercises, depending
upon the time utilized for its practice every day.

Pitman’s Shorthand is based on rules and hence you must be
thorough with all the rules and exceptions included.

After completing the course, you will be able to write in
shorthand, a simple general passage at 40 to 50 words a
minute and with regular practice, 80 words per minute and
above can be achieved.

By sufficient practice your hand speed can be improved
along with familiarity with shorthand outlines.

The way to become an expert shorthand writer is by reading,
copying and taking down from dictation shorthand that is not
only rightly formed by the rules of the system, but also a
good example of shorthand writing in itself.

ADVANTAGES

> Now let us consider the advantages of learning Shorthand:

> Though the computer has encroached into every corner of
our lives, it cannot fit into every area. So far many IT
gadgets have made their entry into office automation, no
such gadget could replace the Stenographer/Personal
Assistant/Private Secretary so far.

> Every Manager needs a Secretary as his/her assistant.

> By learning shorthand your vocabulary and grip on English
language will improve.

> If you choose to learn this beautiful art of shorthand,
otherwise called ‘stenography’, which, when you are
thorough with the rules, would surely fetch you a good
professional employment, where, you will have ample
opportunity for career progression and growth.

> Many shorthand writers (stenographers) reach the top
positions in their organizations.

> At present, there is scarcity for qualified Stenographers.

> A number of Public and Private Organisations are in need of
qualified Stenographers.

This course is designed to explain to you the rules of
shorthand based on the NEW ERA EDITION of SIR ISAAC
PITMAN’s SYSTEM OF SHORTHAND and guide you through
the practice at your convenience and you will be able to
learn the system by yourself.

The exercises in the Instructor Book or those given in the
following lessons should be written and re-written until you

To become a professional in shorthand, you need to practice
hard every day as directed in the lessons and also to
continue to practice shorthand till you get through the

INTRODUCTION

“Shorthand” is defined as “a method of rapid handwriting using
symbols to represent letters, words and phrases.”

The process of writing in shorthand is called Stenography, derived
from two Greek words (‘Stenos’ =narrow + ‘graphie’= writing). It is
also called as brachygraphy (brachy = short) and tachygraphy
(tachys = swift, speedy)

Many forms of shorthand exist using different abbreviating
approaches to record the spoken words.

Pitman’s shorthand is a very scientific system of shorthand for the
English language developed by an Englishman, Sir Isaac Pitman
(1813-1897), with the title “Stenographic Soundhand” in 1837.

Since 1837 this system has been revised many times and several
editions were released. The original Pitman's shorthand had an
"alphabet" of consonants which was later modified. Additional
modifications took place and rules were added/amended in
successive editions.

Pitman New Era Edition was introduced in 1919, had the most
developed set of rules and abbreviation lists.

Though there are other versions like Pitman 2000 etc., you will be
learning the most popular version of the system enunciated in the
New Era Edition.

Stage-1 : Explanation of Rules briefly with correspond-
ing examples.

Stage-2 : Guidance as to how the strokes or outlines are
to be written and practised with brief demo
relating to practice (audio/video are provided
wherever required). Assignment work for
every lesson is given for practice by the
learner by way blank ruled pages with the first
lines written up for initial lessons, wherever
necessary. Exercises and key are provided

LESSON - 1
PITMAN’S SHORTHAND

Pitman’s system is so simple that
every sound in English language is
represented by simple geometrical
forms drawn from these two
circles including four forms with
small initial hooks or circles.

Shorthand is nothing but recording (writing) the sounds heard in
the words (language) in their natural way.

The alphabet in the language consists of ‘consonants’, ‘vowels’ and
‘combination of vowels’.

CONSONANTS

“Consonants are the result of audible friction or stopping of the breath in
some part of the mouth or throat.” (Prof. Sweet).

Consonant is a sound which cannot be produced distinctly without
the aid of a vowel.

In Pitman’s shorthand consonant sounds (such as ‘p’ ‘b’ ‘t’ ‘d’, etc.)
are represented by straight lines or shallow curves which are called
‘strokes’ which differ only in thickness.

The thin stroke represents ‘light' sound such as‘p’, ‘t’ etc., andthe
thick stroke represents corresponding "heavy' sound such as ‘b’ ‘d’
etc.

Some consonant sounds such as ‘f’, ‘th’, ‘s’, ‘m’, ‘I’, ‘r’, ‘sh’ are
represented by thin quarter-circle strokes (called shallow curves), in
various orientations. And some consonants like ‘v’, ‘TH’, ‘z’, ‘ng’,
etc. are represented by thick shallow curves.

NATIONAL SHORTHAND SCHOOL (BOOKS)
Pitman’s Shorthand Online Tutorial

There are 24 simple spoken consonants represented by straight
strokes or shallow curves or initially hooked or initially circled
straight strokes. The consonants ‘r’ and ‘h’ are represented by two
forms, in ‘upward’ and ‘downward’ directions. Hence, the 24
consonants are represented by a total 26 different strokes.

In written English, there are 21 consonants. It is necessary to
combine two written consonants to get a spoken consonant, as in,
‘th’, ‘TH’, ‘sh’, ‘zh’.

The written consonants ‘c’ and ‘s’ have the same consonantal
sound. Hence, both are represented in shorthand by a single stroke.
Similarly, ‘j’ and ‘g’ have the same consonantal sound and are
represented by a single shorthand stroke. Alphabet ‘x’ is a
combination of two sounds ‘k’ and‘s’.

CONSONANTS (ExZcdeute)

The first eight consonants, called “explodents” are represented by
straight strokes. Explodents are consonant sounds formed by the
outgoing breath being forced in a sudden gust through barriers
previously closed.

They are

Now, you have to start practicing the consonants (explodents), as shown in
the following demo pages.

Remember, all the strokes are to be written with the same length i.e. 1/6"
of an inch. At a later stage, you will be taught to write double-length or
half-length strokes. It will, therefore, be necessary that you should
maintain uniform length for the strokes from the beginning.

Strokes are to be written with single infliction of pen/pencil. Over-writing,
correction, erasing, modification are not permitted while writing strokes.

Light (thin) strokes are to be written with light pressure of the pencil.

While writing a thick stroke do not overwrite the thin stroke to get
distinction, but apply a little extra pressure to get the thickness.

You have to practice all the consonant strokes till you are thorough with
them. Pay attention to the sounds of English language, not to the letters of
longhand.

ASSIGNMENT

Start practicing the strokes, commencing from the consonant ‘p’.

‘p’ is a light sound and hence represented by light stroke and ‘b’ is

heavy sound represented by heavy stroke.

Orientation of ‘p’ and —b- is 45° from horizontal, as shown on the
right side demo page.

All the consonant strokes
must be of same length i.e.
1/6" of an inch.

MAXQNQQOQSQQOOOOOMMOuYMYAYOMYOYOXYXXOM AMY OOL

While writing the stroke
each time, say yourself the
name of the stroke i.e. ‘p’
or ‘b’ in this case.

Practice all the explodents,
Pp, b, t, d, Chay, Jay, kay,
gay at least one page
each, as shown in the
demo pages.

Take one or two printouts
of pages 11 to 22 on A5
size paper with portrait
orientation and practice
with short-hand pencil or
shorthand pen.
