    question: 'What is shorthand?',
    answer: 'Shorthand is a system of rapid writing using symbols, abbreviations, and special characters to represent sounds, words, and phrases. It allows you to write much faster than longhand writing.',
    category: 'basics',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa2',
    question: 'Why should I learn shorthand?',
    answer: 'Shorthand is useful for: taking quick notes in meetings, lectures, or interviews; improving writing speed; enhancing career prospects in court reporting, transcription, or journalism; and developing better listening and concentration skills.',
    category: 'basics',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa3',
    question: 'How long does it take to learn shorthand?',
    answer: 'Basic proficiency can be achieved in 3-6 months with regular practice. Professional speed (80-120 words per minute) typically takes 1-2 years of dedicated practice.',
    category: 'basics',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa4',
    question: 'What are the main types of shorthand?',
    answer: 'The main systems include: Gregg (most popular in North America), Pitman (widely used in UK and Commonwealth), Teeline (simplified system), and various other regional systems.',
    category: 'basics',
  },
  
  // Rules
  {
    id: 'qa5',
    question: 'How do I represent vowels in shorthand?',
    answer: 'Vowels are typically represented by small marks (dots, dashes, circles) placed near consonant strokes. In rapid writing, vowels may be omitted if the word is clear from context.',
    category: 'rules',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa6',
    question: 'When should I use shortforms?',
    answer: 'Use shortforms for frequently occurring words (the, and, of, to, etc.) to increase speed. Memorize common shortforms first, then gradually add more specialized ones based on your field.',
    category: 'rules',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa7',
    question: 'What is the principle of phonetics in shorthand?',
    answer: 'Write what you hear, not what you see. Focus on the sounds in words rather than spelling. For example, "phone" would use the "F" sound, not "PH".',
    category: 'rules',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa8',
    question: 'How do I join strokes together?',
    answer: 'Strokes should flow smoothly from one to the next without lifting the pen when possible. This creates word outlines that are faster to write and easier to read back.',
    category: 'rules',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa9',
    question: 'What are blend strokes?',
    answer: 'Blends are single strokes representing common sound combinations like TH, CH, SH, NG, etc. They help reduce the number of strokes needed and increase writing speed.',
    category: 'rules',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa10',
    question: 'How do I represent prefixes and suffixes?',
    answer: 'Common prefixes (un-, re-, pre-) and suffixes (-ing, -ed, -tion) have special abbreviated forms that can be added to word outlines quickly.',
    category: 'rules',
  },
  
  // Practice Tips
  {
    id: 'qa11',
    question: 'How should I practice shorthand daily?',
    answer: 'Practice 30-60 minutes daily: (1) Review strokes and principles, (2) Write word lists, (3) Practice dictation at gradually increasing speeds, (4) Read back your notes.',
    category: 'practice',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa12',
    question: 'What is the best way to build speed?',
    answer: 'Start slow and focus on accuracy. Gradually increase dictation speed by 10-20 words per minute as you become comfortable. Use recorded dictations and practice reading back your notes immediately.',
    category: 'practice',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa13',
    question: 'How can I improve my note reading ability?',
    answer: 'Always read back your notes the same day while the content is fresh. Practice writing clearly and consistently. Develop good habits early to avoid bad penmanship.',
    category: 'practice',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa14',
    question: 'Should I practice with a pen or pencil?',
    answer: 'Use a smooth-writing pen for most practice. A fountain pen or gel pen works well. Pencils can be used but require more pressure. The key is smooth, flowing strokes.',
    category: 'practice',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa15',
    question: 'What materials should I use for practice?',
    answer: 'Use: smooth paper (shorthand notebooks or legal pads), a comfortable pen, dictation recordings or practice materials, and a timer to track your speed progress.',
    category: 'practice',
  },
  
  // Tips
  {
    id: 'qa16',
    question: 'How do I avoid confusion between similar strokes?',
    answer: 'Practice strokes in pairs to learn the differences. Pay attention to direction, size, and angle. Regular practice will build muscle memory and reduce confusion.',
    category: 'tips',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa17',
    question: 'What if I can\'t read my own notes?',
    answer: 'This usually happens when: (1) notes aren\'t read back soon enough, (2) writing is too messy, or (3) you\'re writing too fast for your skill level. Always read back notes promptly and focus on legibility over speed initially.',
    category: 'tips',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa18',
    question: 'How do I handle proper names in shorthand?',
    answer: 'Write proper names in longhand or underline them. Alternatively, write the first occurrence in full and use initials subsequently. Context usually makes names clear.',
    category: 'tips',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa19',
    question: 'Should I omit vowels in shorthand?',
    answer: 'In slow writing, include vowels for clarity. As you gain speed and confidence, you can omit vowels in familiar words where context makes meaning clear. Always include vowels when learning new words.',
    category: 'tips',
  },
  {
    id: 'qa20',
    question: 'How do I stay motivated while learning?',
    answer: 'Set realistic goals, track your progress (words per minute), join shorthand communities online, use it for practical note-taking, and celebrate small improvements. Remember that consistency is more important than intensity.',
