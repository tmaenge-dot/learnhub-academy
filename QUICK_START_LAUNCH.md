2. **Google holds money** → Takes 15% fee
3. **Monthly payout** → Google deposits to YOUR BANK ACCOUNT
4. **You receive 85%** of all revenue

**Timeline**: Sales in January → Paid end of February (NET30)

### 🏦 Setup Required:

**In Google Play Console**:
1. Go to: Settings → Payments profile
2. Add: Your bank account details
   - Bank name
   - Account number
   - Routing/SWIFT number
   - Account holder: Your legal name
3. Complete: Tax forms (W-9 or W-8BEN)
4. Verify: Via microdeposits

**Then**:
- Google pays → Your bank account (monthly)
- You can transfer → Bank to PayPal (manually or auto)

**Your Contact Email**: tmaenge@gmail.com (use for Google Play account)
